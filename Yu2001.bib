abstract = {Large software systems are difficult to understand and maintain. Program$\backslash$ndependency analysis plays a key role in both understanding and maintenance.$\backslash$nThis paper discusses hidden dependencies among software components$\backslash$nthat make both understanding and maintenance hard. A hidden dependency$\backslash$nis a relationship between two seemingly independent components, and$\backslash$nit is caused by the data flow in a third software component. The$\backslash$npaper uses abstract system dependency graphs to define hidden dependencies.$\backslash$nIt discusses the impact of hidden dependencies on the process of$\backslash$nchange propagation and also discusses an algorithm that warns about$\backslash$nthe possible presence of hidden dependencies},
