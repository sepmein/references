abstract = {Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are powerful sequence models that were believed to be difficult to train, and as a result they were rarely used in machine learning applications. This thesis presents methods that overcome the difficulty of training RNNs, and applications of RNNs to challenging problems. We first describe a newprobabilistic sequence model that combines Restricted Boltzmann Machines and RNNs. The new model is more powerful than similar models while being less difficult to train. Next, we present a new variant of the Hessian-free (HF) optimizer and show that it can train RNNs on tasks that have extreme long-range temporal dependencies, which were previously considered to be impossibly hard. We then apply HF to character-level language modelling and get excellent results. We also apply HF to optimal control and obtain RNN control laws that can successfully operate under conditions of delayed feedback and unknown disturbances. Finally, we describe a random parameter initialization scheme that allows gradient descent with mo- mentum to train RNNs on problems with long-term dependencies. This directly contradicts widespread beliefs about the inability of first-order methods to do so, and suggests that previous attempts at training RNNs failed partly due to flaws in the random initialization},
