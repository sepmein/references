abstract = {Broadly speaking, probability theory is the mathematical study of uncertainty. It plays a central role in machine learning, as the design of learning algorithms often relies on proba-bilistic assumption of the data. This set of notes attempts to cover some basic probability theory that serves as a background for the class. 1.1 Probability Space When we speak about probability, we often refer to the probability of an event of uncertain nature taking place. For example, we speak about the probability of rain next Tuesday. Therefore, in order to discuss probability theory formally, we must first clarify what the possible events are to which we would like to attach probability. Formally, a probability space is defined by the triple (Ω, F, P), where • Ω is the space of possible outcomes (or outcome space), • F ⊆ 2 Ω (the power set of Ω) is the space of (measurable) events (or event space), • P is the probability measure (or probability distribution) that maps an event E ∈ F to a real value between 0 and 1 (think of P as a function). Given the outcome space Ω, there is some restrictions as to what subset of 2 Ω can be considered an event space F: • The trivial event Ω and the empty event ∅ is in F. • The event space F is closed under (countable) union, i.e., if $\alpha$, $\beta$ ∈ F, then $\alpha$ ∪ $\beta$ ∈ F. • The even space F is closed under complement, i.e., if $\alpha$ ∈ F , then (Ω $\backslash$ $\alpha$) ∈ F. Example 1. Suppose we throw a (six-sided) dice. The space of possible outcomes Ω = {\{}1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6{\}}. We may decide that the events of interest is whether the dice throw is odd or even. This event space will be given by F = {\{}∅, {\{}1, 3, 5{\}}, {\{}2, 4, 6{\}}, Ω{\}}.},
