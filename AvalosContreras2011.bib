abstract = {“Node.JS”, an event-oriented framework for coding JavaScript programs on the server side, is$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncoming out as an emergent technology for creating efficient and scalable network applications$\backslash$r$\backslash$nof high performance and low memory consumption. Yet, its characteristic of handling several,$\backslash$r$\backslash$neven thousands, of connections by using one single process, opts to be a vulnerability when$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncreating highly available applications. Thus, a research has been conducted to confirm if this$\backslash$r$\backslash$nframework is capable of meeting such requirements despite the odds.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nDuring the course of this investigation, a study about failures in Internet Services has been$\backslash$r$\backslash$nconducted, showing that the technology chosen is not the most common reason for service$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndisruptions. In addition, a prototype, based on a Fault Model Enforcement and design patterns$\backslash$r$\backslash$nfor fault tolerant software, was developed to monitor an Instant Messaging service (also written$\backslash$r$\backslash$nin JavaScript) at system and application level and to provide redundancy by communicating$\backslash$r$\backslash$nwith other nodes within a cluster system whenever it crashes.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nThe results obtained through a series of fault-injection testings show the functionalities of the$\backslash$r$\backslash$nnewly created system, confirming that Node.JS seems to meet the requirements needed to$\backslash$r$\backslash$ndevelop a highly available program. Further testing in regards to stability and CPU usage,$\backslash$r$\backslash$ntogether with the implementation of better tools for monitoring, can improve the robustness of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe system.},
