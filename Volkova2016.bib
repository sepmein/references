abstract = {Photoelectric spectra of heterostructures containing InAs quantum dots (QDs) produced in different technological regimes were studied. A simple nondestructive method to reveal a bimodality of the QDs' size distribution was described. The method based on the analysis of the shape of InAs/GaAs QDs' photoelectric spectra and their temperature dependencies. The quantitative analysis of the temperature dependencies of the photoelectrical spectra was performed. All possible emission processes occurring from quantum confined levels to the semiconductor matrix were considered at the simulation. The surface concentration of the QDs was estimated.},
