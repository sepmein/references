abstract = {Modern websites are powered by JavaScript, a ﬂexible dynamic scripting language that executes in client browsers. A common paradigm in such websites is to include third-party JavaScript code in the form of libraries or advertisements. If this code were ma- licious, it could read sensitive information from the page or write to the location bar, thus redirecting the user to a malicious page, from which the entire machine could be compromised. We present an information-ﬂow based approach for inferring the effects that a piece of JavaScript has on the website in order to ensure that key security properties are not violated. To handle dynamically loaded and generated JavaScript, we propose a framework for staging in- formation ﬂow properties. Our framework propagates information ﬂow through the currently known code in order to compute a min- imal set of syntactic residual checks that are performed on the re- maining code when it is dynamically loaded. We have implemented a prototype framework for staging information ﬂow. We describe our techniques for handling some difﬁcult features of JavaScript and evaluate our system's performance on a variety of large real- world websites. Our experiments show that static information ﬂow is feasible and efﬁcient for JavaScript, and that our technique al- lows the enforcement of information-ﬂow policies with almost no run-time overhead.},
