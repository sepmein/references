abstract = {The association between ambient temperature and mortality has been established worldwide, including the authors' prior study in California. Here, they examined cause-specific mortality, age, race/ethnicity, gender, and educational level to identify subgroups vulnerable to high ambient temperature. They obtained data on nine California counties from May through September of 1999â€“2003 from the National Climatic Data Center (county- wide weather) and the California Department of Health Services (individual mortality). Using a time-stratified case- crossover approach, they obtained county-specific estimates of mortality, which were combined in meta-analyses. A total of 231,676 nonaccidental deaths were included. Each 10?F({\~{}}4.7?C) increase in mean daily apparent temperature corresponded to a 2.6{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval (CI): 1.3, 3.9) increase for cardiovascular mortality, with the most significant risk found for ischemic heart disease. Elevated risks were also found for persons at least 65 years of age (2.2{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 0.04, 4.0), infants 1 year of age or less (4.9{\%}, 95{\%} CI: ?1.8, 11.6), and the Black racial/ethnic group (4.9{\%}, 95{\%} CI: 2.0, 7.9). No differences were found by gender or educational level. To prevent the mortality associated with ambient temperature, persons with cardiovascular disease, the elderly, infants, and Blacks among others should be targeted},
