abstract = {The relationship between the Breteau index, the House index, and the occurrence of dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever in the 6 zones of Kuala Lumpur was studied throughout 1994. Cases of dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever varied between zones and between months, ranging from 0 to 21 cases. In most of the zones in Kuala Lumpur, the occurrence of dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever has no relationship with the Breteau and House indices. Cases of dengue/dengue hemorrhagic fever occurred in all zones despite the low Breteau and House indices.},
