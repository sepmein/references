abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversar- ial process; in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution; and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather thanG. The train- ing procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D; a unique solution exists; with G recovering the training data distribution andD equal to 1 2 everywhere. In the case where G andD are defined by multilayer perceptrons; the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference net- works during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples. 1},
