abstract = {The large size and the dynamic nature of theWeb make it necessary to continually maintainWeb based information retrieval systems. Crawlers facilitate this process by following hyperlinks inWeb pages to automatically download new and updatedWeb pages. While some systems rely on crawlers that exhaustively crawl the Web, others incorporate “focus” within their crawlers to harvest application- or topic-specific collections. In this chapter we discuss the basic issues related to developing an infrastructure for crawlers. This is followed by a review of several topical crawling algorithms, and evaluation metrics that may be used to judge their performance. Given that many innovative applications ofWeb crawling are still being invented, we briefly discuss some that have already been developed.},
