abstract = {Increased threat of mosquito-borne disease coupled with decreased tolerance of nuisance mosquitoes has opened a market for pest management professionals to offer mosquito control services for homeowners. A pest management professional applied bifenthrin (0.08{\%}) and lambda-cyhalothrin (0.1{\%}) at their maximum label concentrations as barrier treatments. We tested treatments residual efficacy in reducing adult mosquito populations and compared these chemicals against a water control at 24 residential properties (eight replications by three treatments). Mosquito populations were measured on each property by using five methods: CO2-baited Centers for Disease Control (CDC) light traps (without a light), human landing rates, CDC gravid traps, ovitraps, and sweep nets. Populations were monitored weekly for 2 wk before treatment and 8 wk posttreatment. Additionally, to confirm residual efficacy of each insecticide, a randomly treated leaf underwent a no-choice bioassay with laboratory-reared Aedes albopictus (Skuse). Trap collections were dominantly Aedes albopictus and Culex pipiens L. Both insecticidal treatments significantly reduced Aedes spp. lambda-Cyhalothrin- and bifenthrin-treated sites had 89.5 and 85.1{\%} fewer Ae. albopictus bites than the untreated control, respectively. Ae. albopictus bioassay results showed significant residual efficacy for both insecticides up to 6 wk posttreatment. There were no significant differences between properties treated with the two insecticides. In contrast, Culex spp. were not reduced by either insecticidal treatment. Our study indicated that barrier sprays applied to low-lying vegetation do not properly target adult daytime resting sites for Culex mosquitoes but that they can reduce Aedes mosquitoes. Perhaps by treating upper tree canopies Culex spp. abundance may be reduced.},
