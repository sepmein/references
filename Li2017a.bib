abstract = {Zika virus (ZIKV) has become a serious threat to global health since the outbreak in Brazil in 2015. Additional Chinese cases have continuously been reported since the first case of laboratory-confirmed ZIKV infection in China on 6 February 2016. Aedes aegypti is the most important vector for ZIKV. This study shows that two strains from China exhibit high levels of midgut infection and highly disseminated infection of salivary glands and ovaries. Both strains can transmit ZIKV to infant mice bitten by infectious mosquitoes. Moreover, the results provide the evidence of transovarial transmission of ZIKV in mosquitoes. The study indicates that the two Ae. aegypti strains are not only effective transmission vectors but also persistent survival hosts for ZIKV during unfavorable inter-epidemic periods. This function as a reservoir of infection has epidemiological implications that further enhance the risk of potential future outbreaks.},
