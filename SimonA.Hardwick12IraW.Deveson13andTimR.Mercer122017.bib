abstract = { Next-generation sequencing (NGS) provides a broad investigation of the genome,$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand it is being readily applied for the diagnosis of disease-associated genetic features.$\backslash$r$\backslash$nHowever, the interpretation of NGS data remains challenging owing to the size and complexity of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nthe genome and the technical errors that are introduced during sample preparation, sequencing$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand analysis. These errors can be understood and mitigated through the use of reference$\backslash$r$\backslash$nstandards — well-characterized genetic materials or synthetic spike-in controls that help to$\backslash$r$\backslash$ncalibrate NGS measurements and to evaluate diagnostic performance. The informed use of$\backslash$r$\backslash$nreference standards, and associated statistical principles, ensures rigorous analysis of NGS data$\backslash$r$\backslash$nand is essential for its future clinical use.},
