abstract = {Regression testing is a necessary but expensive maintenance$\backslash$nactivity aimed at showing that code has not been adversely affected by$\backslash$nchanges. Regression test selection techniques reuse tests from an$\backslash$nexisting test suite to test a modified program. Many regression test$\backslash$nselection techniques have been proposed, however, it is difficult to$\backslash$ncompare and evaluate these techniques because they have different goals.$\backslash$nThis paper outlines the issues relevant to regression test selection$\backslash$ntechniques, and uses these issues as the basis for a framework within$\backslash$nwhich to evaluate the techniques. The paper illustrates the application$\backslash$nof the framework by using it to evaluate existing regression test$\backslash$nselection techniques. The evaluation reveals the strengths and$\backslash$nweaknesses of existing techniques, and highlights some problems that$\backslash$nfuture work in this area should address},
