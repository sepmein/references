abstract = {The World Health Organization (WHO) through its depart-ment of vaccines and biologicals 1 already offers informa-tion and recommendations on the vaccines represented in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI). Accord-ing to its global mandate, the department is now assuming an extended normative role in this field, and is issuing a series of regularly updated position papers on other vac-cines and vaccine combinations against diseases that have an international public health impact. These position pa-pers are concerned primarily with the use of vaccines in large-scale immunization programmes; limited vaccina-tion for individual protection, as executed mostly in the private sector, may be a valuable supplement to the nation-al programmes, but is not emphasized in this policy docu-ment. The position papers summarize essential back-ground information on the respective diseases and vac-cines, and conclude with the current WHO position con-cerning their use in the global context. The papers have been reviewed by a number of experts inside and outside WHO, and are designed for use mainly by national public health officials and immunization programme managers. However, the position papers may also be of interest to in-ternational funding agencies, the vaccine manufacturing industry, the medical community and the scientific media.},
