Cases of Zika virus disease were reported in Micronesia in 20071 and then in French Polynesia in 2013.2 In French Polynesia, Guillain-Barr{\'{e}} syndrome was reported for the first time in a few patients following Zika virus infection. In Brazil, Zika virus was introduced in 2014,3 and was subsequently associated with cases of microcephaly. So far, an estimated minimum of 400 000 cases of Zika virus disease have been reported in 24 states in Brazil, although the number of cases could be far higher.},
