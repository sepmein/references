abstract = {Objective: We explored whether use of deep learning to model temporal relations among events in electronic health records (EHRs) would improve model performance in predicting initial diagnosis of heart failure (HF) compared to conventional methods that ignore temporality. Materials and Methods: Data were from a health system's EHR on 3884 incident HF cases and 28 903 controls, identified as primary care patients, between May 16, 2000, and May 23, 2013. Recurrent neural network (RNN) models using gated recurrent units (GRUs) were adapted to detect relations among time-stamped events (eg, disease diagnosis, medication orders, procedure orders, etc.) with a 12-to 18-month observation window of cases and controls. Model performance metrics were compared to regularized logistic regression, neural net-work, support vector machine, and K-nearest neighbor classifier approaches. Results: Using a 12-month observation window, the area under the curve (AUC) for the RNN model was 0.777, compared to AUCs for logistic regression (0.747), multilayer perceptron (MLP) with 1 hidden layer (0.765), sup-port vector machine (SVM) (0.743), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN) (0.730). When using an 18-month observation window, the AUC for the RNN model increased to 0.883 and was significantly higher than the 0.834 AUC for the best of the baseline methods (MLP). Conclusion: Deep learning models adapted to leverage temporal relations appear to improve performance of models for detection of incident heart failure with a short observation window of 12â€“18 months. OBJECTIVE Before diagnosis of a disease, an individual's progression mediated by pathophysiologic changes distinguishes those who will eventually get the disease from those who will not. Detection of temporal event sequences that reliably distinguish disease cases from controls may be particularly useful in improving predictive model performance. We investigated whether recurrent neural network (RNN) models could be adapted for this purpose, converting clinical event se-quences and related time-stamped data into pathways relevant to early detection of disease. Electronic health record (EHR) data capture rich clinical and re-lated temporal information. Patient health care encounters are well documented (eg, diagnoses, medications, and procedures) and time-stamped. However, EHR data are highly complex, given the struc-ture and breadth of information captured (spanning provider behav-ior, care utilization, treatment pathways, and patient disease state) and irregular sampling frequency. To date, most predictive modeling work using EHR data rely on aggregate features (eg, event count and event average). Temporal relations among disaggregated fea-tures (eg, medication ordered at one time and procedure performed at another) are not captured using these methods. We applied RNN models to heart failure (HF) cases and controls using longitudinal EHR data, and compared the model performance to traditional machine learning approaches. HF is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality among elderly individuals in de-veloped economies and accounts for significant and growing health care expenditures. 1,2 Improved early detection could open new op-portunities for delaying or preventing progression to diagnosis of HF and reduce cost.},
