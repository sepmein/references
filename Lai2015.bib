abstract = {Text classification is a foundational task in many NLP applications. Traditional text classifiers often rely on many human-designed features, such as dictionaries, knowledge bases and special tree kernels. In contrast to traditional methods, we introduce a recurrent con-volutional neural network for text classification with-out human-designed features. In our model, we apply a recurrent structure to capture contextual information as far as possible when learning word representations, which may introduce considerably less noise compared to traditional window-based neural networks. We also employ a max-pooling layer that automatically judges which words play key roles in text classification to cap-ture the key components in texts. We conduct experi-ments on four commonly used datasets. The experimen-tal results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several datasets, partic-ularly on document-level datasets.},
