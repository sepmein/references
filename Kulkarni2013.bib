abstract = {We posit that visually descriptive language offers com- puter vision researchers both information about the world, and information about how people describe the world. The potential benefit from this source is made more significant due to the enormous amount of language data easily avail- able today. We present a system to automatically gener- ate natural language descriptions from images that exploits both statistics gleaned from parsing large quantities of text data and recognition algorithms from computer vision. The system is very effective at producing relevant sentences for images. It also generates descriptions that are notably more true to the specific image content than previous work.},
