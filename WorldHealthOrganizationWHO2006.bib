abstract = {A technical working group meeting on dengue was held at the headquarters of the World Health Organization (WHO) in Geneva, Switzerland, on 10–12 December 2012. The main objective of the meeting was to brainstorm and develop action plans to implement the Global strategy for dengue prevention and control, 2012–2020. The Global strategy was published in 2012 to address the growing threat of dengue. It aims to provide advice on how to move from a reactive response in an emergency situation to a proactive and sustainable approach involving risk assessment, early warning systems and preventive measures, guided by entomological and epidemiological surveillance. The Global strategy emphasizes the many new opportunities provided by country experiences and recent research (including vaccine development) that can be seized to reduce morbidity and mortality, and build capacities that increase resilience to future outbreaks. The objectives of the global strategy include reducing, by 2020, morbidity of the disease by 25{\%} and mortality by 50{\%} (using 2010 estimates as base line). The meeting was attended by 12 participants (see Annex I: List of participants). Dr Ronald Rosenberg was appointed as Chairman and Dr Lee Ching Ng as Rapporteur. The meeting was held in plenary sessions and included in-depth discussion of the challenges and future course of action in diagnostics, case management, burden estimates, outbreak preparedness and vector control. The meeting also discussed the status of vaccine development and strategies for advocacy and resource mobilization. The first one-and-a-half-days of the meeting were held in the presence of observers for the purposes of exchanging information and sharing views, after which the WHO-appointed experts further discussed the subject and recommended the following key priority action points for 2013–2015. 1.
