abstract = {Pyrethroid, carbamate, and organophosphate insecticides are frequently used for bed bug control. A baseline susceptibility study for commonly used insecticides was carried out with a susceptible C. lectularius laboratory strain. LD50 mg a.i./m² -values against a susceptible strain in a contact bioassay format are 1.4 mg a.i./m², and 6.5 for deltamethrin, and bendiocarb, respectively. The studies are supplemented with biochemical investigations on enzyme systems commonly known to confer resistance in insect pests. Data from laboratory trials are compared to field trials with deltamethrin and the combination of deltamethrin with natural pyrethrins plus the synergist piperonyl butoxide as tank mix. This combination achieved control results against strong infestations and less susceptible C. lectularius.},
