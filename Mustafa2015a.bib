abstract = {Dengue fever is a re-emerging public health problem with two-fifths of the world population being at risk of infection. Till now, dengue fever was believed to be caused by four different serotypes. The fifth variant DENV-5 has been isolated in October 2013. This serotype follows the sylvatic cycle unlike the other four serotypes which follow the human cycle. The likely cause of emergence of the new serotype could be genetic recombination, natural selection and genetic bottlenecks. There is no indication of the presence of DENV-5 in India. Recent clinical trials with the promising Chimerivax tetravalent vaccine suffered a setback. Discovery of DENV-5 and more such sylvatic strains in future may further impede the Dengue Vaccine Initiative. Integrated Vector Management holds the key to sustainable dengue control. Further epidemiological and ecological studies are needed to detect additional sylvatic dengue strains.},
