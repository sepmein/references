abstract = {Machine learning (ML) refers to a set of automatic pattern recognition methods that have been successfully applied across various problem domains, including biomedical image analysis. This review focuses on ML applications for image analysis in light microscopy experiments with typical tasks of segmenting and tracking individual cells, and modelling of reconstructed lineage trees. After describing a typical image analysis pipeline and highlighting challenges of automatic analysis (for example, variability in cell morphology, tracking in presence of clutters) this review gives a brief historical outlook of ML, followed by basic concepts and definitions required for understanding examples. This article then presents several example applications at various image processing stages, including the use of supervised learning methods for improving cell segmentation, and the application of active learning for tracking. The review concludes with remarks on parameter setting and future directions. Immunology and Cell Biology advance online publication, 4 April 2017; doi:10.1038/icb.2017.16 INTRODUCTION Machine learning (ML) refers to a set of computational tools many of which are so prevalent today that the reader is likely to benefit from them several time a day without realising it. ML methods have been applied for route planning in car navigation systems, spam filtering, movie recommendation and identifying people in photos. 1–3 ML methods have a rich history in quantifying imaging results, including biomedical image analysis, which is the focus of this review. 4–6 An image analysis pipeline considered here comprises a series of processing steps as shown in Figure 1. 6–10 Images generated by a microscopy system are subject to noise and other acquisition artefacts, such as uneven sample illumination and fluorescence cross-talk, and often require a correction stage. 11–13 Next, cells' outlines need to be identified in individual frames, a task known as cell segmentation. In turn, cell tracking refers to maintaining cell identities throughout the video sequence. Obtaining corrected images or cell tracks is usually not the final aim, but a prerequisite for addressing the main purpose of the study, for example, categorisation of tissues by morphology or cells by phenotype. More recent analysis pipelines are complemented with tools for online results sharing and collaboration. 10,14 Although this review focuses on applications of light microscopy at the cellular level, some of the processing steps are similar in other imaging settings. For example, segmentation is also required for locating cell organelles in electron microscopy images. 15 Each processing stage poses a number of computational challenges. For example, cell segmentation can be difficult due to inherent variability in cell appearance; cell tracking can be hard in the presence of multiple overlapping objects; and categorisation of cells trajectories can be non-trivial due to varying lengths of tracks. In response to these challenges, there has been a wide array of proposed methods. A dozen of algorithms have been evaluated for illumination correction alone, 11,12 and many cell segmentation and tracking methods have been reviewed by Meijering and colleagues. 16,17 In addition, image analysis pipelines often include interactive user interface, to allow human input, for correcting results of automatic methods. 18–20 This article is centred on ML methods. These methods are characterised by several hallmarks. First, ML algorithms are oriented towards pattern discovery (for example, finding clusters) or prediction (for example, phenotype from cell appearance). Second, ML approaches are generic and can typically be applied across a broad range of problem domains, including different stages of the analysis pipeline. Third, many ML methods include optimisation as a major component, and are capable of optimising ('learning') most of method parameters from data. Previous reviews have covered a range of ML algorithms in bio-imaging. 4–6 Since ML is a large and dynamic discipline, inevitably other methods with demonstrated utility have received less attention. Some of these methods and recently reported applications are covered in the present review. This paper is oriented towards giving a broad coverage rather than an in-depth tutorial on any particular topic. Also, from my perspective, it is instructive to start with a brief historical overview, before introducing ML concepts necessary for presenting methods and applications.},
