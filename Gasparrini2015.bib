abstract = {This study, using a huge database and very advanced statistical analysis methods, estimated the proportion of temperature-related deaths attributable to cold and to heat. Cold appears to cause a much greater proportion of deaths than heat, and extreme temperatures have substantially less effect compared to that of moderate but not optimum temperatures.},
