abstract = {Dengue fever has become a major public health concern in recent decades. The following document is an operational guide on how to perform Aedes aegypi 1 pupal productivity surveys. These surveys are used to identify the most productive dengue vector breeding sites so that they can be targeted for interventions. The use of pupal productivity surveys and the targeted control of the most productive breeding sites, (i.e. those that produce {\textgreater} 70{\%} of all Ae. aegypti pupae; with pupae serving as a proxy measure for adult mosquitoes), has been promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR), over the last decade. This strategy is based on the outcomes of multicentre studies of pupal survey techniques and on the cost-effectiveness of targeted interventions (e.g. Focks, 2003; Focks and Alexander, 2006; McCall and Kittayapong, 2007; McCall, Lloyd {\&} Nathan, 2009; Tun Lin et al., 2009; WHO, 2009). Since the Ae. aegypti eradication campaigns of the 1940s in the Americas (Nathan, Focks {\&} Kroeger, 2006), vector infestation levels have been determined by house-to-house surveys investigating the presence of immature stages of the vector (larvae and pupae) in water containers. The results are used to calculate the conventional Stegomyia indices: the house (or premise) index, the container index and the Breteau index (the number of positive containers per 100 houses inspected). However, the limitations of these indices in accurately estimating vector densities and ultimately dengue transmission risk, were acknowledged in an informal consultation at the World Health Organization in 1999 (WHO, 2000). After a decade of revising dengue vector entomological survey methods and indicators (Focks, 2003), a series of studies were conducted under the sponsorship and coordination of TDR and the WHO Department for Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD). Subsequently, recommendations were issued to incorporate pupal productivity surveys alongside traditional larval surveys to determine the most productive water container types, in order to design more targeted and cost-effective vector-control interventions. The methodology was validated in a nine-country study in Asia, Africa and Latin America e.g. Focks {\&} Alexander 2006; Lenhart et al., 2006), and the cost-effectiveness of targeted interventions by another multi-centre study involving eight countries in Asia and Latin America (Tun Lin et al., 2009). Other studies have followed giving further confirmation to the value of pupal productivity surveys (e.g. Arunachalam et al., 2010; Pilger et al., 2011; Seng et al., 2009). The following document summarizes the Standard Operational Procedures (SOPs) for conducting pupal productivity surveys.},
